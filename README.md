# Active-Aero
Arduino sketches from my Active Aero project

<h1 This is a spoiler that I am iteratively engineering (and collaboratively designing) for my friend's 1990 Mustang GT that he is building.>

The idea first started out as just a simple sketch on the back of a notecard I had lying around . . .

To Do:
- Purchase motor controller with BEC or Buck regulator
- Figure out how to incorporate manual override switch with preset modes
- Faster actuator?
