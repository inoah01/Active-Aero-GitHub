# Active-Aero
(This is repo to house Arduino sketches from my Active Aero project)


### This is a spoiler that I am iteratively engineering (and collaboratively designing) for my friend's 1991 Ford Mustang LX that he is building. He is designing the bodykit for the car as well as swapping in the 5.0 V8 from the 1990 Mustang GT.
*A full status update with more videos is in the works (at which point this will move to GitHub Pages), but for now, enjoy some photos and a quick clip :)*


The idea first started out as just a simple sketch on the back of a notecard I had lying around . . .

Then my friend, Devin Kakuda, an artist studying at The College of Creative Studies (CCS) and also the owner of the Mustang, began designing renders of how the spoiler would be integrated into the car . . .

To Do:
- Record higher quality demo videos
- Purchase motor controller with BEC or Buck regulator
- Figure out how to incorporate manual override switch with preset modes
- Faster actuator?
